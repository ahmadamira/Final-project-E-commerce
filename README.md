# Project Idea and Business

The project idea is an e-commerce website called ”NorthStar” that sells clothing items. The website will allow customers to browse through the available
products, add them to their cart, and place orders.
The main goal of NorthStar is to provide customers with an easy and convenient way to shop for clothing items online. The website will provide a platform
where customers can view the products and place orders without having to leave
their homes.

###  Firebase Services

I will be using several Firebase services for the backend of NorthStar:
• Firebase Authentication: This service will be used to authenticate users
and protect their personal information.
• Firebase Realtime Database: This service will be used to store and retrieve
data, such as product information and customer orders.
• Firebase Hosting: This service will be used to host the website and make
it accessible to users.
• Firebase A/B testing .

### Conclusion

In conclusion, NorthStar will be a fully functional and user-friendly e-commerce
website that provides customers with an easy and convenient way to shop for
clothing items online. By using React, we can create a visually appealing and
responsive user interface that allows customers to easily browse and purchase
products. With the use of Firebase services, we can provide a secure and reliable backend for storing and retrieving data, handling user authentication, and
hosting the website.

### Please note that the website is not complete yet and expected to be finished at the 31th of may.
